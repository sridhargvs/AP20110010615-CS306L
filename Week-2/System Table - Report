In the given symbol Table program, I took an expression by this I define the tokens in the given one 
And every token is compared and classified as the following way given in the example below
Ex: I took ‘a’ is identifier, any digit as constant, = as operator and <= and many as relational operator
I took the expression and declared character array which I defined size of 50 and I took integer data type 

Output: -
 
Enter expression (terminated by $):x=a+b
Given Expression:x=a+b

Symbol   addr                    type
x        0x555d4d35cac0          identifier

 =       0x555d4d35cb40          operator

a        0x555d4d35cb90          identifier

 +       0x555d4d35cc00          operator

b        0x555d4d35cc40          identifier
	

Therefore they are divided into address and type of the given ones.
